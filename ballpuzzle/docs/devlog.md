# Development Log

This document tracks development decisions, challenges, and progress on the ball puzzle solver.

## 2025-01-07 - Project Initialization

### Architecture Decisions
- **Coordinate System**: Chose FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) lattice for natural ball packing
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into distinct modules (coords, pieces, solver, io, reporting)
- **Engine Pattern**: Pluggable solver engines with common interface
- **Schema Validation**: JSON schemas for all data interchange formats

### Technical Choices
- **Language**: Python 3.8+ for broad compatibility and rich ecosystem
- **Dependencies**: Minimal core dependencies (numpy, jsonschema, click, tqdm, pydantic)
- **Testing**: pytest for comprehensive test coverage
- **CLI**: Click for user-friendly command-line interface
- **Progress**: tqdm for real-time progress visualization

### Implementation Highlights

#### Coordinate System
- FCC lattice provides 12-neighbor connectivity vs 6 for cubic
- Canonical transformations eliminate rotational/translational symmetries
- Reduces search space by orders of magnitude

#### Solver Architecture
- Abstract `SolverEngine` base class for extensibility
- `CurrentEngine` provides stable interface while allowing backend changes
- DFS engine with configurable optimizations

#### Optimization Strategies
1. **Heuristics**: Piece ordering by size, complexity, and fit
2. **Pruning**: Connectivity checks, feasibility analysis
3. **Symmetry Breaking**: Canonical state representation
4. **Caching**: Transposition table with LRU eviction

#### Data Management
- JSON schemas ensure data integrity
- Separate I/O classes for each data type
- Comprehensive metadata tracking
- Event logging for debugging and analysis

### Performance Considerations
- Memory-efficient piece representation
- Lazy evaluation of piece orientations
- Configurable cache sizes
- Progress checkpointing for long runs

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core algorithms
- Integration tests for solver engines
- Property-based testing for symmetry operations
- Performance benchmarks on standard problems

### Future Enhancements
- Additional solving engines (A*, beam search, genetic algorithms)
- Parallel processing support
- Web interface for visualization
- Advanced heuristics based on machine learning
- Problem decomposition for large puzzles

## Development Notes

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Symmetry Handling**: Complex rotational symmetries in 3D space
2. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing completeness with speed
3. **State Representation**: Efficient canonical forms for caching
4. **User Experience**: Informative progress reporting without overhead

### Solutions Implemented
1. **24-Rotation Matrix**: Complete cubic symmetry group
2. **Multi-Level Optimization**: Heuristics + pruning + caching
3. **Hash-Based Keys**: Compact state representation for transposition table
4. **Configurable Reporting**: Optional progress tracking with minimal impact
